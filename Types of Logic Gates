Logic gates are very small but an important  part of computers they are working on binary numberes(0 or 1).
FIrst we give 1 or 2 input to a gate then it will give us a single outpur,Diffrent types of gates gives diffrent types of output.
There are diffrent types of gates like AND,OR,NOT etc. These three are Important gates, we can make some other gates by using these gates.
Example- NAND gate is combination of AND and NOT.
Logic Gates and their truth tables---
For AND-
A(first Intput)      B(Second Intput)   A AND B(Output)
0                       0                 0
0                       1                 0
1                       0                 0
1                       1                 1
For OR-
A(first Intput)      B(Second Intput)   A OR B(Output)
0                       0                 0
0                       1                 1
1                       0                 1
1                       1                 1
For NOT-
A(Intput)      NOT A(Output)
0                      1              
1                      0
